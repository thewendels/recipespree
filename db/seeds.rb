Transfer the potatoes carefully into the oil (I use a large metal spatula) and toss them lightly to coat each potato with the hot oil. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees F.

Use 1 tablespoon of the oil to grease a rimmed sheet pan. Place the salmon filets, skin-side down, on the pan, leaving space between them; drizzle the salmon with 2 tablespoons of the oil. Sprinkle the spice mix evenly over the salmon.\n    Prepare the Kale: In a medium bowl, using tongs, toss the kale with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, the minced garlic, and a pinch of salt. Arrange it all around (but not covering) the salmon; it's okay to pile it up a bit, as it will shrink significantly as it roasts.\n    Place the pan on the lower-middle rack and roast for 12 to 14 minutes for medium-cooked salmon. (If you prefer your salmon medium-rare, cook 10 to 12 minutes. For well-done, cook 15 to 17 minutes.) Remove the pan from the oven and drizzle the honey over the fish. Then sprinkle the lime zest and juice over the fish. Serve immediately.", notes: nil, image_url: "https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2020/10/Sheet-Pan-Blackened-Salmon-760x988.jpg"},

With mixer running, add eggs one at a time, letting each incorporate fully before adding the next. Reduce speed to low, then add the flour all at once. When flour is incorporated, add chocolate chips and nuts and keep mixing until dough is homogeneous.\n    \n    Divide dough into 8 equal portions (about 6 ounces/170g each) and round each into a smooth ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 12 hours before baking; if well protected from air, the dough can be kept in the fridge up to 1 week.\n    \n    To Bake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Line an aluminum half-sheet pan with parchment paper. When the oven comes to temperature, arrange up to 4 portions of cold dough on prepared pan, leaving ample space between them to account for spread. If you like, sprinkle with additional salt to taste.\n    \n    Bake until cookies are puffed and lightly brown, about 22 minutes or to an internal temperature of between 175 and 185°F (79 and 85°C). The ideal temperature will vary from person to person; future rounds can be baked more or less to achieve desired consistency.\n    \n    Cool cookies directly on baking sheet until no warmer than 100°F (38°C) before serving. Enjoy warm, or within 12 hours; these cookies taste best when freshly baked (see Make-Ahead and Storage).", notes: nil, image_url: "https://www.seriouseats.com/2019/02/20190131-levain-style-chocolate-chip-cookies-vicky-wasik-20.jpg"},
